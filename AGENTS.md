# AGENTS.md – Unity Project Guidelines


## Language & Style
- Use Python
- do NOT add test cases, or test of edge cases.
- make code naive


## Agent Behavior
- Explain EACH line of code using a minimum of two sentence comments.  These comments should explain what that code does, and why that implimentation was used.
- After any edit, write a report on what you changed, and why.
